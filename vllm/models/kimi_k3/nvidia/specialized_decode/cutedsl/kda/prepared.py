"""Prepared KDA core. One packed projection supplies Q/K/V, the output gate, F_A and
beta; per-batch policies select the gate schedule and the projection row pitch. Verify
batches the caller lists in ``prepared`` also get ``KdaVerifyPrepared``, which reads
the operands an in-projection epilogue prepared (``run(..., prepared=...)``) and polls
the projection's F_A rows: the caller arms them (every BF16 element ``FA_SENT``) before
the first run and gives that projection buffer to this path only; each run re-arms
them."""
